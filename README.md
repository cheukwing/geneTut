# geneTut
Genetic algorithm based on a tutorial from ai-junkie, which can be found at http://www.ai-junkie.com/ga/intro/gat1.html.

The genetic algorithm has been modified from the tutorial to instead try to generate a string through successive generations.

Previously this repository contained an implementation of C, however I decided to remove this as I did not find it to be a satisfactory implementation.
The Kotlin implementation was originally made to further practise the algorithm following the C implementation and to learn the Kotlin language.
